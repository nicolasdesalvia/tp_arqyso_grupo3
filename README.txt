Hi! We are the group 3 from ArqySo, conformed by Tomas Azzaretti, Valentin Eandi, Nicolas De Salvia, Leonardo Decroce and Davidson Losier.
We are from Rosario, Argentina and we study Programing in the UTN FRRO.
For using this project the first thing you have to do is execute some comands once you are step on the project folder.
If you don`t have the folder, here is the DockerHub command to pull it:
docker pull tomiazza37/tpgrupo3:latest
Then we can continue with the instructions

The first command to run is:
docker-compose build

The next one, once docker-compose build had run:
docker-compose up -d

And thats it! everything should be working properly.
We expect you have a good experience whit this project, and hope it be useful for you! See you next time!
